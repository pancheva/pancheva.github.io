My work is in the areas of syntax, semantics, and their interface. It employs formal modeling, cross-linguistic comparison from a synchronic and diachronic perspective, and experimental methods. My main projects include:

* degree expressions
* person and perspective
* tense and aspect 
* evidentiality
* clitics and clause structure
* free relatives
