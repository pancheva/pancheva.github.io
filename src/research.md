My work is in the areas of syntax, semantics, and their interface. It involves formal modeling, cross-linguistic comparison from a synchronic and diachronic perspective, and experimental methods. My main ongoing projects include _degree expressions_, _tense and aspect_, _evidentiality_, _person and perspective_; previous projects include _clitics and clause structure_, _free relatives_

My research has been supported by NSF grants (BCS-0418581, PI, and BCS-1917619, Co-PI, with M.L. Zubizarreta, PI), an Andrew Mellon New Directions Fellowship, and the USC-awarded Advancing Scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences Research grant and Zumberge Research and Innovation grant.
