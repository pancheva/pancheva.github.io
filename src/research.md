My work is in the areas of syntax, semantics, and their interface. It employs formal modeling, cross-linguistic comparison from a synchronic and diachronic perspective, and experimental methods. My main projects include:

* degree expressions
* person and perspective
* tense and aspect 
* evidentiality
* clitics and clause structure
* free relatives

My research has been supported by NSF grants (PI: BCS-0418581; Co-PI: with M.L. Zubizarreta, PI, BCS-1917619), an Andrew Mellon New Directions Fellowship, and the USC-awarded Advancing Scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences Research grant and Zumberge Research and Innovation grant.
